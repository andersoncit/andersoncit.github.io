<p>Some more fashion tips include wearing the appropriate shirt for
your tie. A personal opinion is that the more simple your outfit is, the better. A
little known secret is that wearing “loud” clothes is not popular anymore and is
actually quite tacky. An example of loud would be considered wearing bright
blue suits with extreme ties and crazy socks. The whole point of making your
style look sharp and concise is that you are respected by those that associate
with you and most importantly, respected by yourself. Wearing loud clothes will
only draw negative attention to yourself and people will not be able to take you
seriously. Now going back to the importance of your dress shirt, it is vital that
your shirt is not wrinkled. The only thing worse than a wrinkled shirt is a stained
shirt. Please, do not ever wear either a wrinkled or stained dress shirt.</p>
