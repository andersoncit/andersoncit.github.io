<h3>Grooming</h3>
<p>Weâ€™ve talked a lot about clothing items. I want to emphasize the cherry on
top which is your grooming state. You must have a nice hairdo and if you have facial
hair, it must be trimmed and look neat. Remember the key is looking respectable and
classy at the same time. This will look better than going for a messy outside the box
look.</p>
